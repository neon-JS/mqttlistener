# MqttListener [WIP]
A very basic MQTT listener in Swift.

## About
This project is just a playground for me to learn some Swift and get into MQTT. It is not made for _any_ production use and will probably be WIP for a long time. 

## Goals
- Connect to MQTT5 servers and subscribe to topics.
- Handle incoming messages.
- Conform to the MQTT5 protocol for all implemented features.
- Getting a better understanding of Swift and MQTT.
